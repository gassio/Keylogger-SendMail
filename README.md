# Python Keylogger for Linux

Hi!, this is a keylogger writed on Python for Linux.

A keylogger is a program that records your keystrokes, this program saves them in a .txt file on your local computer and, after 30 seconds (or as long as you want), it will close the .txt file and send you an email with everything that has been recorded.
once the program is run, this cycle will last infinitely if you don't stop it.

-time(module)
-datetime(module)
-smptlib(module)
-Pynput(library)

#### Install pynput

***pip install pynput***

Feel free to edit, or add whatever you want into the project!
